        <h1>Dear Maryam, <br><br>

            I hope this letter finds you well and brings a smile to your face. I’ve been thinking about you so much lately, and I just wanted to take a moment to put my feelings into words.<br><br>
            
            First and foremost, I love you. More than I can ever fully express. You are such an incredible person, and every day I’m reminded of how lucky I am to have you in my life. Your kindness, your strength, and your determination inspire me in ways I can’t even describe.<br><br>
            
            I know things can feel overwhelming sometimes, especially with your studies and everything else going on, but I want you to remember that everything is going to be okay. You are so capable, so intelligent, and so resilient. I have no doubt that you’ll overcome any challenge that comes your way. Take it one step at a time, and don’t forget to be kind to yourself along the way. You’re doing amazing, even if it doesn’t always feel like it.<br><br>
            
            No matter what happens, I’ll always be proud of you. Proud of the person you are. You’re truly one of a kind, and I’m so grateful to be by your side, cheering you on every step of the way.<br><br>
            
            Remember, I’m here for you—always. Whether you need someone to talk to, a shoulder to lean on, or just a reminder of how loved you are, I’ve got you. We’re in this together, and I believe in you more than words can say.<br><br>
            
            Take care of yourself, my love. I can’t wait to see you again and hold you close. Until then, know that you’re loved, missed, and cherished more than anything.<br><br>
            
            <a href="#" class="heart-link">With all my heart,</a><br>
